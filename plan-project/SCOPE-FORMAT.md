# <Project Name>: Scoping

## TLDR

2-3 bullets max. Hyper short, very high level — what are we conceptually implementing?
- ...

## Prior Reading

Links a reader needs before evaluating the scope. Keep this minimal.

- RFC/design doc: [LINK NEEDED]
- Figma designs: [LINK NEEDED]
- _(add or remove entries as needed)_

## Goal

One or two sentences: what this project delivers and why.

## Background

Context a reader needs to evaluate the scope, such as prior work, existing systems/frameworks
being built on, and any in-flight efforts that do or don't block this. Link sources.

**Omit this section** if there's a linked RFC/design doc in Prior Reading — readers can follow
the link for background.

## In Scope

The work being planned into tickets. If it helps, group into **milestones** (only when
grouping clarifies — not every project needs them). Within each, list concrete tasks
and reference the code/areas they touch.

### Milestone 1: <name>
**Scope:** one line on what this milestone covers.
**Tasks:**
1. ...
2. ...

### Milestone 2: <name>
...

## Ordering / Dependencies

What blocks what, and in what order things must land. Centralize all sequencing here rather
than scattering it across milestones. Keep any Mermaid graph at the milestone level -- show how milestones gate each other,
not individual tasks. A graph is recommended when the milestone structure is non-trivial. A
prose or bullet list is fine for simpler cases. Task-level dependencies (e.g. "M2 is gated
on M1.3") belong in the Internal/External bullets below, not the graph.

- **Internal:** dependencies between milestones or tasks within this plan (e.g. "M2 is gated on M1.3").
- **External:** prerequisites owned by other teams or systems, with status if known.

## Out of Scope

Work explicitly excluded that isn't already ruled out by the RFC/design doc — things a reader
might reasonably expect to be in scope. Being explicit here prevents scope creep during planning.

## Observability / Success Metrics

How we'll know the rollout works and whether it succeeded:
- **Telemetry:** metrics, logs, traces, dashboards to add or rely on.
- **Success metrics:** the numbers that define success (adoption, error rate, latency,
  conversion, etc.) and where they're measured.

## Maintenance

Operational burden after rollout:
- **Ownership:** who owns this going forward. Include **code ownership / CODEOWNERS**
  only if there are cross-team ownership considerations.
- **Operational:** alerting, runbooks, on-call impact, recurring upkeep.

## Documentation

What needs writing so others can use/operate this, and who's the audience:
- **Docs:** user-facing docs, internal runbooks, READMEs, API reference — whatever the
  work obligates. Note where they live.
- **Blogpost (optional):** if the work warrants external/internal announcement, scope a
  blogpost as a deliverable (audience, key message, owner).

## Rollout (optional)

Keep minimal or omit if not relevant:
- **Feature flags:** consider a flag for anything public/customer-facing — any change to
  observable behavior (UI, APIs, backend behavior) — so it can be shipped dark, tested,
  and rolled back without a revert. Note the flag(s) and gating.
- Staged rollout / cohorts and rollback plan, where relevant.
