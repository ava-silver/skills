# Post Review

## Key Rules

1. **All actionable comments must be inline** — GitHub's review body doesn't support threaded replies. Body = brief summary only.
2. **Ask for approval level first** (COMMENT / REQUEST_CHANGES / APPROVE) via AskUserQuestion before posting anything.
3. **Use heredoc piped to `--input -`** — `--field` silently rejects the comments array.

## Workflow

1. Identify the PR (or `gh pr view --json number,url`).
2. Gather from the conversation: inline comments with file path, line number, body; and a 1-2 sentence body summary.
3. Ask approval level via AskUserQuestion.
4. Get head SHA: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number} --jq '.head.sha'`
5. Post:

```bash
cat <<'PAYLOAD' | gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews -X POST --input -
{
  "commit_id": "<sha>",
  "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES",
  "body": "<short summary only>",
  "comments": [
    { "path": "path/to/file.go", "line": 42, "side": "RIGHT", "body": "..." }
  ]
}
PAYLOAD
```

For multi-line spans add `"start_line"` and `"start_side": "RIGHT"`.

6. Report success and link to the review.
